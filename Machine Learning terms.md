## Machine Learning terms

**Gaussian Process** : A probability distribution over possible functions.  See https://towardsdatascience.com/an-intuitive-guide-to-gaussian-processes-ec2f0b45c71d  

**Markov Decision Process** : in reinforced learning, an agent is supposed to decide the best action to select based on his current state. When this step is repeated, the problem is known as a Markov Decision Process.

**LSTM** : Long short-term memory. See https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/
